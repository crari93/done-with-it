# done-with-it

My first React Native App

![React Native Resume App Template](done-with-it.png?raw=true "React Native Resume App Template")

## Description

This React Native app is a simple Todo App, nothing fancy here.

## Project Info

This app was created using React Native with Expo and coded in Visual Studio Code.

## How to see the App

You can enter this link: <a target="_blank" href='https://expo.io/@crari93/projects/done-with-it'>Expo project repository</a>

To access the app, you need to download eht <a target="_blank" href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=es-419'>Expo app for Android</a>so you can scan QR code from the page yo use the app on your Android device.

If you can't download the Expo App, in the Expo project repository link, click where it says "Open Project in the Browser" below the QR Code, then click the purple button "Open Project", and a window will pop-up. Something like this:

![Browser App Template](browser-app.png?raw=true "Browser App Template")

Now you just need to tap where it says "Tap to Play". There will be a queue, you will need to wait a little so you can start using the app.

Once the queue disapears, scroll down and tap where it says "Open Project Using Expo".

And done!!
You can now use the app on a Web browser.

## How to use the App

Just write something in the black text box that it's on the bottom of the app, and the tap where it says "✔️ Add new Task".

After the task is added, just tap on it to delete it.
